# DS Tree
* DS Tree
* Binary Tree

>> * Strict Binary Tree
>> * Complete Binary Tree

* Properties:

>>  * The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^(l-1)
>>  * Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is (2^(h+1))-1
>>  * In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

* Main applications of trees include:

>> 1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
>> 2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).
>> 3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
>> 4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
>> 5. Router algorithms
>> 6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).

* Binary Search Tree(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)

>> * pre-order traversal (root -> left -> right)
>> * in-order traversal (left -> root -> right)
>> * post-order traversal (left -> right -> root)
