* DS Tree
* Binary Tree

>> * Strict Binary Tree
>> * Complete Binary Tree

>>  * The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^(l-1)
>>  * Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is (2^(h+1))-1
>>  * In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

* Binary Search Tree

>> * pre-order traversal
>> * in-order traversal
